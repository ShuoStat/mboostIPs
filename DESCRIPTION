Description: Influential points(IPs) should be routinely conducted for any
    types of regression models. However, it is rarely mentioned in
    high-dimension data.  One of the possible reason is the lack of IPs
    detection tools. mboostIPs is an extension of mboost, that help check
    the IPs specifically for glmboost() function. The method is based on
    leave-one-out. The idea is to evaluate the influence of a case by
    comparing the model fitted without the questioned cases to the
    reference models. The function can identify IPs for variable selection
    or prediction.
